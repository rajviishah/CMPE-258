**Assignment 6 : Practice transfer learning and supervised contrastive learning**

Part 1 - supervised contrastive learning  - Using new loss 

Write a colab to demonstrate supervised contrastive learning loss based supervised classification versus regular softmax based one

Hint : Check colab links at https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UxtHDwjViC7VpSb0zB-kajGQ-TwznQmc-7LsbHRfO3s/edit#slide=id.gcdc5f16e5b_20_5 (Links to an external site.) and https://towardsdatascience.com/contrastive-loss-for-supervised-classification-224ae35692e7 (Links to an external site.) - Also check https://keras.io/examples/vision/supervised-contrastive-learning/ (Links to an external site.) 

Please provide necessary visualizations

Part 2 - Transfer learning on various modalities : 
Write simple colabs to transfer learn on images, videos, audios -  - with both as a feature extractor as well as a fine tuning usecases
