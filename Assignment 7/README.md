**Assignment 7 - Recurrent neural network and its applications**

Part 1 : Sequence to sequence task : Demonstrate the use of RNN, LSTM, GRU, WAVENET  for a timeseries prediction task (next 10 items)  and show  it works better than regular classification

Hint : colab https://github.com/ageron/handson-ml2/blob/master/15_processing_sequences_using_rnns_and_cnns.ipynb  (Links to an external site.)and chapter 15 

 

Part 2: Demonstrate very simple many to one, one to many and many to many RNN colabs

Part 3: Bidirectional RNN : Sequence to vector task : Demonstrate bidirectional RNN and all its features in sequential MNIST task classification colab
